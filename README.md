## APP USE INSTRUCTIONS ## 

This is an app designed to replicate the functionality of the popularity handheld game, Simon.  Click the link to be taken to the main app page.  To use the app, click the start button.  Once the start button is clicked, Simon will pick a color from four of the available color panels.  Your goal is to click on the color panel that Simon chose.  Once your choice is made, click the submit button and if your choice is the same as Simon's, you will procede to the next round.  With each round you advance to, an additional panel is chosen by Simon from the four available panels, thus increasing the difficulty level of the game with each addition round. 
With each round you make it to, your score increases. 

Try the Simon game out for yourself and see how long you can keep up with simon.
